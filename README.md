# Composite Materials Research For Solar Car
## Abstract
This report documents the process of learning, applying, and validating
composite material techniques for use in a solar car project. With no
prior experience in composites, the work focused on understanding material
behavior, fabrication methods, and basic testing approaches. Composite
sandwich structures were designed and manufactured for a battery box, and
a scalable manufacturing method was developed for the aeroshell. Wet lay
up, vacuum bagging, and mold making techniques were explored through
hands on fabrication. Mechanical testing following ASTM standards was
conducted to validate design decisions, and preliminary simulation work
was performed using ANSYS. The report serves as both a record of accomplishments
and a reference for future teams working with composite
materials in the solar car project.
